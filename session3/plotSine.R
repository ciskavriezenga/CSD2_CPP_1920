# Let t indicate the index of a sample,
# then the equation is as follow.
# sample =  sin((t * 2 * pi) / samplerate)
# 
# and: 
# phase = t / samplerate 
# within the interval [0, 1]
# 
# Rewriting the equation.
# sample = sin(2 * pi * phase)
# 
# It is therefore sufficient to keep track of the phase 
# and to increase this at each sample step.
# phase += 1 / samplerate
# 
# To also take the frequency into account, 
# we can simply add it as follow.
# phase += frequency / samplerate
